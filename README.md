My name is most definitely Zimon.

My interests have a way of boundlessly creating an ever-unmanageable catalogue of themselves. But they usually fall into things related to a few categories:
Reading & Writing, Drawing, (excessively heavy) music, Exercise & especially Nutrition. Also, quite evidently, Computer Science, which my degree would strongly indicate.

Am I learning something beyond the uninhibited amassing of knowledge that tags along living just one day longer than yesterday?
Well, in lieu of mandated learning directions, I'm playing around with this: https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/most-popular-programming-languages/ .

I'm looking to collaborate on anything that help me not only advance my understanding of all these wondrous, complicated things we've been obsessing over the last ~40 years,
but that would also assist me in paying my rent. ;)

I'm available most directly through my e-mail: zmk.professional@gmail.com. Since my complete name can be (*cough*) inferred from my username, my LinkedIn, Messenger,
and I suppose Instagram (there's only a slew of poor pencil drawings there, but to each their own) should be easily located.
