My name is most definitely Zimon.

My interests have a way of boundlessly generating an ever-unmanageable collection of themselves. But they usually fall into things related to a few categories:
Drawing, (excessively heavy) music, exercise & nutrition, and gaming. Also, quite evidently, Computer Science, which my degree would strongly indicate.
