My name is most definitely Zimon.

My interests have a way of boundlessly creating an ever-unmanageable catalogue of themselves. But they usually fall into things related to a few categories:
Reading & Writing, Drawing, (excessively heavy) music, Exercise & especially Nutrition. Also, quite evidently, Computer Science, which my degree would strongly indicate.
